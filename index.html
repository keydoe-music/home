    <h1 align="center">Key Doe</h1>
    <h2 align="center">Key Doe is an artist out of Missouri. He dropped his
         first ever single "Alone" in highschool that gained a
          lot of attention from his classmates. With a follow up
           EP called "On My Last" that shares his loss of his 
           mom, his dad being locked up and also losing a best 
           friend to gun violence. The looks of it Key Doe
            doesn't plan on stopping his journey any time soon. 
            Every song is filled with raw pain that leaves people
             with chills.</h2>
